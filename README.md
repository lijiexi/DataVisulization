I use a bar chart to represent Response Rates in different Workforce Size between different industries. by clicking on the button on the picture, you can show the response rate of different workforce companies. while clicking on the button next to it, you can switch to a stacked bar chart. When the mouse is hovered over the image, the response rates for different workforce industries are displayed.

I have divided the trade status into continuing and temporarily suspended or temporarily suspended. You can click on the buttons at the bottom of the image to see the transactions for the different workforce companies.

I use special line graphs to visualise the differences between companies in terms of transactions.

I have introduced two maps to represent the distribution of different trading statuses in each region. I have set a gradient colour which becomes darker when there are more people in a particular area. The map can also be zoomed in and out using the mouse, and when the mouse is hovered over a region it will show the trading status of that region, and when the mouse is moved to the virtual box in the bottom left corner the map will change as the mouse is moved.

I have created a multi-dimensional line graph to represent the application of government policies by companies, with details displayed when the mouse hovers over the image. By clicking on the button above the image, you can choose which specific policies are displayed for application.

In order not to make the visualisation so monotonous, I introduced a heat map to represent the different businesses that have received the policy. As the value gets larger, the colour of the blocks in the picture gets darker. When the mouse is hovered over the virtual box below the image, the blocks that match the requirements on the image stand out, which brings this image to life.

For the description of the different workforce companies, I have still chosen a line graph, but unlike before, this graph loads dynamically with a mouse click. This gives a sense of change. As before, it is possible to interact with this chart by hovering, clicking and toggling actions.
